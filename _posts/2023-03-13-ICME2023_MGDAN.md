Abstract: 

Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) aims to align shared classes between the source and the target domain and recognize the private classes of the target domain as unknown. Although unknown classes represent semantic novelty, current OSDA benchmarks lack clear definitions of semantic categories. We propose to use fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) datasets for the issue because of their specific descriptions of semantic classes. This introduces the new setting named fine-grained OSDA. The entanglement among FGVC, unknown class recognition, and domain adaptation makes fine-grained OSDA a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity discriminative adversarial network. It utilizes multi-grained labels of the source domain and curriculum learning to improve FGVC performance, exploits discriminative information to recognize unknown classes, and adapts domains through a conditional domain discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
