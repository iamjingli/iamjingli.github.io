Currently，I co-supervise master students with other professors of [ICV(the Institute of Computer Vision,计算机视觉研究所)(https://icv.tjut.edu.cn/index.htm)]. I recruit one or two master students in machine learning and computer vision every year. Undergraduate students are also welcomed to join my research group.
Please drop me an email if you're interested in choosing me as your supervisor or working with me.
Contact: lj#email.tjut.edu.cn (replace # with @).
